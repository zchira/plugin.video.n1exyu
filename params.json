{"name":"Tv N1-Info for Kodi/XBMC","tagline":"Kodi plugin for TV N1 Info","body":"### About\r\nThis is [Kodi](kodi.tv) plugin for [N1-Info](n1info.com) regional tv station. N1-Info covers ex-Yu region (Serbia, Croatia and BiH).\r\nIt allows you to watch live streams for any of three regions. \r\n\r\nThis isn't official plugin and I am not in any connection with TV N1.\r\nI made it for my personal use, because my cable tv operator doesn't have N1-Info channel in any packets.\r\n\r\n### Screenshoots\r\n\r\n![](http://s29.postimg.org/ihk61k7o7/Screenshot1.png)\r\n\r\n![](http://s29.postimg.org/p6qphkt07/Screenshot2.png)\r\n\r\n![](http://s29.postimg.org/owj6y8edz/Screenshot3.png)\r\n\r\n![](http://s29.postimg.org/kpyciwes7/Screenshot4.png)\r\n\r\n![](http://s29.postimg.org/z7vjqw63b/Screenshot5.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
